Overview:

Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a viral infection that poses a significant threat to the global cattle industry. It is caused by the capripoxvirus from the Poxviridae family and is characterized by nodules or lumps on the skin, often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, reduced milk production, and decreased fertility. Severe cases can lead to permanent hide damage, lower meat quality, and increased mortality rates. The economic impact of LSD outbreaks includes reduced productivity, higher disease management costs, and trade restrictions, affecting both livelihoods and food security.

Objective:

This research aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of LSD diagnosis in cattle by applying advanced deep learning techniques. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on visual inspection by veterinarians, which can be subjective and prone to human error, particularly in the early stages of the disease. These limitations often lead to delayed diagnosis, ineffective management, and significant economic losses in the livestock sector.

Approach:

To address these challenges, this study introduces a deep learning-based diagnostic system utilizing a fine-tuned DenseNet-121 model. This deep neural network is known for its superior feature extraction capabilities, enabling it to identify subtle disease-specific patterns in images. The proposed model is designed to accurately classify images of infected and healthy cattle, supporting veterinarians in making timely and precise diagnoses.

Additionally, the research incorporates the use of a large language model (LLM) to enhance the interpretability of the diagnostic system. By generating heatmaps that highlight crucial regions in the input image contributing to classification, this approach improves transparency and trust. The integration of LLM technology also facilitates contextual analysis, aiding veterinarians in understanding the decision-making process of the model.

Impact:

By leveraging deep learning and advanced visualization techniques, this research aims to provide veterinarians with a robust and transparent tool for early detection and timely intervention of LSD outbreaks. This, in turn, can lead to more effective disease management strategies, mitigating economic losses and safeguarding cattle populations worldwide.
